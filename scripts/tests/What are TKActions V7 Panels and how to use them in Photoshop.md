# What are TKActions V7 Panels and how to use them in Photoshop?
 
TKActions V7 Panels are a set of tools that allow you to create and apply pixel-based masks in Photoshop, such as luminosity masks, color masks, saturation masks, and more. They are designed to help you enhance your images by making precise selections and adjustments based on the tonal and color values of your pixels.

TKActions V7 Panels consist of two main modules: the Go module and the RapidMask module. The Go module is a new addition that simplifies the mask-making process by using a three-step workflow: MASK, MODIFY, and OUTPUT. The RapidMask module is an updated version of the previous TK panels that offers a more advanced and flexible way to create and modify masks using different sources and methods.
 
Both modules are modular and customizable, so you can arrange them in your Photoshop workspace according to your preference. They also come pre-programmed with six common languages: English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, and Chinese. You can choose the language you prefer from the menu.
 
To use TKActions V7 Panels in Photoshop, you need to install them as extensions using the Extension Manager or ZXP Installer. You can find detailed instructions on how to do this on the [official website](https://goodlight.us/writing/actionspanelv7/tk7.html) of the developer, Tony Kuyper. You can also watch video tutorials by Sean Bagshaw on how to use the panels effectively on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwLmQbF0QYtZJxXJZn06O9g).
 
TKActions V7 Panels are compatible with Photoshop CC 2014 through Photoshop 2021. They do not work in Photoshop CS6 or earlier versions. They are available for purchase on the [Panels & Videos page](https://goodlight.us/panels-and-videos.html) of Tony Kuyper's website.
  
Let's take a closer look at how to use the Go module and the RapidMask module in TKActions V7 Panels. The Go module is a simplified way to create and apply masks in three steps: MASK, MODIFY, and OUTPUT. You can choose from different types of masks, such as Lights, Darks, Midtones, Zones, Color, Saturation, Vibrance, and My Channels. You can also use the Calculated Masks feature to combine any two masks with different blending modes. Once you have chosen a mask, you can modify it using various options, such as Levels, Curves, Brightness/Contrast, Color Range, Paint/Burn/Dodge, Camera Raw Filter, and more. You can also invert or feather the mask if needed. Finally, you can output the mask as an adjustment layer, a pixel layer, a selection, or a layer mask. You can also save the mask as an alpha channel for later use.
 
The RapidMask module is a more advanced and flexible way to create and apply masks using different sources and methods. You can use the SOURCE menu to choose from different pixel data as the starting point for making masks, such as RGB channels, Lab channels, CMYK channels, Color Zones, and more. You can also use your own alpha channels or selections as sources. Then you can use the MASK menu to generate a spectrum of masks based on the source data. You can choose from different types of masks, such as Lights-1 through Lights-6 (and vice versa for Darks), Zone-0 through Zone-11 (and vice versa for ZoneD), and Color-1 through Color-6 (and vice versa for ColorD). You can also use the View button to see the mask on your image as a red overlay. Next, you can use the MODIFY menu to fine-tune your mask using various options, such as Levels/Curves/Contrast/Range sliders, Mask-the-Rapid-Mask buttons (to intersect masks), Mask Calculator (to add or subtract masks), and more. You can also invert or feather the mask if needed. Finally, you can use the OUTPUT menu to output the mask as an adjustment layer, a pixel layer, a selection, or a layer mask. You can also save the mask as an alpha channel for later use.
 
Both modules have some common features that make them easy to use and customize. For example, you can change the accent color of the panel by right-clicking on any button and choosing a color from the menu. You can also track which button you last clicked by looking at the accent-colored shadow around it. You can also access some useful menus by clicking on the TKâº button or the Userâº button on each module. The TKâº button gives you access to some actions, color tools, and blending options that are useful for working with masks and layers. The Userâº button allows you to assign your own actions or scripts to any of the 16 user-programmable buttons on each module. You can also use the Instant Action (âº) button to run any action or script without assigning it to a button.
